# MMD3005 gas sensor (NH3, H2S, TVOC)

The MMD3005 gas sensor module is a gas sensor module developed based on the smart sensor independently developed by 
Huiwen Technology. It can be used to simultaneously identify and detect the composition and content of ammonia, TVOC and 
hydrogen sulfide in the air. The sensor module has both temperature and humidity detection function. The sensor of the MMD3005 
series module is a multi-channel gas sensor composed of different material systems. It uses specific conditioning circuits and precise 
algorithms to convert the response to conductivity changes into electrical signals corresponding to gas types and concentrations.
